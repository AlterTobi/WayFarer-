# WayFarer+
A Chrome extension to add more functionality to NianticLab's Wayfarer

Changelog
---
1.6:
- Ctrl-less zooming on maps (review, nominations)

- Small general code improvements

1.5:
- Added 20m and 40m circles to both map views on the review page. These allow you to see if other portals are too close, and from what area players of Ingress, Wizards Unite and Pokemon Go can access the PoI (if it were to appear in those games)
